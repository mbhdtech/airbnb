### AirBnb Clone Project

This is a simple project that I decided to undertake to get my hands dirty with react and elastic search.
React is something I've been wanting to do for a while, and with the help of the ReactiveSearch components I used, it was easy to use components that have the Elastic Search functionalilty built right in to them.

## Setup

- The dataset for the AirBnB was grabbed from www.kaggle.com
- This dataset was then hosted on a platform called Appbase.io. 
- The app was initially created with the standard create react app command.
- Then the reactivesearch components were installed using a terminal command -> `yarn add @appbaseio/reactivesearch`

## Appbase

- In order to connect Appbase to our react app, we had to grab the credentials from Appbase and place them within the ReactiveSearch code in `App.js`.
